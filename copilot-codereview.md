# Code Review: Excursion Landing Page

## Overview
This review evaluates the current implementation of the Excursion landing page in `index.html` and `style.css`. Overall, the page matches the design mock, uses clear, simple markup, and applies consistent styling.

---

## Whatâ€™s Working Well

- **Semantic Structure**: Use of `<header>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` provides a clear document outline.
- **Styling Consistency**: Font choices, colors, and spacing match the redline mock.
- **Responsive Media**: Video and images are constrained to fit mobile-like widths, with `max-width` and centered layout.
- **Asset Management**: Resources are well organized under `resources/css`, `resources/images`, and `resources/videos`.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Add `<main>` Element**:
   - Wrap the core content (`hero-video`, `intro-text`, images, etc.) in a `<main>` tag to improve accessibility and document flow.

2. **Meta Tags for SEO & Accessibility**:
   - Include a `<meta name="description" content="...">` in the `<head>` to improve search engine previews.
   - Add `aria-label` or `role` attributes where appropriate (e.g., video container).

3. **Enhance Responsive Design**:
   - Use responsive units (`rem`, `%`) and media queries to adjust font sizes or padding on smaller/larger screens.
   - Consider a fluid grid or flex layout for sections if more layout complexity is added.

4. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Optimize images (e.g., compress JPEG, use modern formats like WebP).
   - Lazy-load non-critical images with `loading="lazy"`.
   - Add `preload` for the hero video to improve perceived load time.

5. **Accessibility (A11y)**:
   - Ensure meaningful `alt` text for all images (e.g., descriptive text for the campsite image).
   - Provide captions or a transcript for the background video, if content conveys information.

6. **Fallback Styles**:
   - Provide background-color fallback under video for browsers without video support.
   - Ensure links have focus styles for keyboard navigation.

## Next Steps
- Implement the `<main>` wrapper and additional meta tags.
- Add basic media queries to refine the layout on tablet and desktop.
- Optimize assets and consider lazy-loading strategies.
- Test with a screen reader to verify accessibility improvements.

## Post-Review Phase 3.2 Feedback

After implementing semantic, accessibility, and responsive enhancements, here are observations and minor suggestions:

- **Semantic Structure**: The `<main>` wrapper correctly encloses core sections, improving document outline and screen reader navigation.
- **Meta Description**: Added for SEO; ensure it accurately reflects any future content changes.
- **ARIA Labels & Roles**: Each section has a descriptive label; consider reducing redundancy by relying on native landmarks (e.g., `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`) where possible.
- **Focus Styles**: Visible focus outlines work well. For consistency, you may add similar outlines to other interactive elements (e.g., video controls if custom controls are added).
- **Responsive Query**: The basic media query scales typography; consider extending to layout (e.g., multi-column grids) if new content is introduced.
- **Final Touches**: Double-check alt texts for clarity (e.g., update "Phone icon" to "Mobile app icon").

Overall, the page is now well-structured, accessible, and responsive, ready for final polish and content freeze.
