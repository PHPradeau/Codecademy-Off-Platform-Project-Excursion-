## Live Demo

- Standard version: [index.html](https://phpradeau.github.io/Codecademy-Off-Platform-Project-Excursion-/index.html)
- Enhanced version: [index-enhanced.html](https://phpradeau.github.io/Codecademy-Off-Platform-Project-Excursion-/index-enhanced.html)

## Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Git & GitHub Pages
- Developed with Visual Studio Code and GitHub Copilot (o4-mini agent)

## Process

1. **Planning**: Created `copilot-plan.md` outlining each phase from setup to enhancement.
2. **Implementation**: Developed `index.html` and `resources/css/style.css` following the design mock.
3. **Code Review**: Conducted two rounds of reviews documented in `copilot-codereview.md`.
4. **Testing**: Simulated accessibility and responsiveness tests in `copilot-test-report.md`.
5. **Refinement**: Adjusted media sizing, semantics, and responsiveness per reviews.
6. **Enhancement**: Generated `index-enhanced.html` and `resources/css/style-enhanced.css` for a polished design.
7. **Deployment**: Deployed to GitHub Pages on the `main` branch.
