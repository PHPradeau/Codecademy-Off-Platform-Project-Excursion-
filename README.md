## Live Demo

- Standard version: [index.html](https://phpradeau.github.io/Codecademy-Off-Platform-Project-Excursion-/index.html)
- Enhanced version: [index-enhanced.html](https://phpradeau.github.io/Codecademy-Off-Platform-Project-Excursion-/index-enhanced.html)

## Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Git & GitHub Pages
- Developed with Visual Studio Code and GitHub Copilot (o4-mini agent)

## Process

1. **Planning**: Created `copilot-plan.md` outlining each phase from setup to enhancement.
2. **Implementation**: Developed `index.html` and `resources/css/style.css` following the design mock.
3. **Code Review**: Conducted two rounds of reviews documented in `copilot-codereview.md`.
4. **Testing**: Simulated accessibility and responsiveness tests in `copilot-test-report.md`.
5. **Refinement**: Adjusted media sizing, semantics, and responsiveness per reviews.
6. **Enhancement**: Generated `index-enhanced.html` and `resources/css/style-enhanced.css` for a polished design.
7. **Deployment**: Deployed to GitHub Pages on the `main` branch.

## Acknowledgments

This project was assisted by GitHub Copilot using the o4-mini agent. 

The enhanced version was generated automatically by the Copilot agent, while the standard version was authored collaboratively.
Like you see this version, even interesting, is not the one asked in the exercise at all.
